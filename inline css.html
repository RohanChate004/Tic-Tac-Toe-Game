    <p style="padding-left: 50; color: rgb(255, 8, 0);"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Tatio">El Tatio</a> is
        a geothermal field with many geysers located in the Andes Mountains of northern Chile at 4,320 metres (14,170
        ft) above mean sea level. It is the third-largest geyser field in the world and the largest in the Southern
        Hemisphere. The geothermal field has many geysers, hot springs, and associated sinter deposits. These hot
        springs eventually form the Rio Salado, a major tributary of the Rio Loa, and are a major source of arsenic
        pollution in the river. The vents are sites of populations of extremophile microorganisms such as
        hyperthermophiles, and El Tatio has been studied as an analogue for the early Earth and possible past life on
        Mars.</p>
