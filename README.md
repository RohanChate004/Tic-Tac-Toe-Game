Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 

<b>Basic Rules</b>
1. Players and Setup: The game is for two players, one using "X" and the other "O". It's typically played on a grid made of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines.
2. Turns: Players take turns marking an empty square with their symbol.
3. Winning: The first player to get three of their marks in a straight line (across, up and down, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. Draw: If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a tie, often called a "cat's game". 

<b>Strategy and Gameplay</b><br>
If both players use optimal strategy, the game will always end in a draw. The game is often used as a teaching tool for basic strategy, observation, and even concepts in artificial intelligence.
